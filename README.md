### Info

This website started as a basic concept which I showed to a real company who were very interested inhiring me. At the time there wasn't much content as I didn't want to give them my work for free. 
It's probably a good thing I did, since they stopped responding to me shortly after I sent it to them. Since then I have removed their actual company name and continued to work on the project as I honestly really liked
the way it was turning out, and I had so many ideas. Plus I had already started doing research on the project since I was expecting to sign a contract with them shortly. I like to be prepared. Enjoy!
