## Info

A quick template website I built in my spare time as a rough example of a modern website for a real estate & construction company based in Cyprus.
This is only a very basic site and an example of what I can do in a couple of hours!

## Local Hosting

Open a preview or browser with this command: ```python3 -m http.server```
Stop with CTRL + c in terminal.
