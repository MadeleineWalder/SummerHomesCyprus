## Link to live site: https://madeleinewalder.github.io/summerhomes.com/

### Info

A quick, unfinished site. Built as a rough example of a modern website for a Real Estate company based in Cyprus.
This is only a very basic site and an example of what I can do in just an hour or two.


### Analysis

- Minimal navbar to not overwhelm with information
- Focus on making people want to live abroad with beautiful fullscreen image
- Question to make users curious and want to continue looking
- 'Begin' button to easily access the rest of the site


### Local Hosting

Open a preview or browser with this command: ```python3 -m http.server```
Stop with CTRL + c in terminal.
