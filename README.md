### Info

This website started as a basic concept art. I created it for a real company who were very interested in hiring me. 
At the time it only consisted on the landing page with the full-screen image, as I didn't want to do too much work for free. 
It's a good job too as they stopped responding to me shortly after for no apparant reason. 
I was really disapointed as they said in a meeting that they would love to have me on the team.
I had so many ideas and had done so much planning as well as research. I didn't want it to go to waste, so I continued working on it anyway, 
removing the name of the company and replacing it with a made up one.
